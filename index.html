        <p class="NERMIEN">
            Nermien Riad is the founder and executive director of Coptic Orphans, an award-winning international Christian
            development organization.
            Coptic Orphans unlocks the God-given potential of the most vulnerable children in Egypt, empowering them to break
            the
            cycle of poverty and become change-makers in their communities through the power of education.
            Ms. Riad founded Coptic Orphans in 1988 and worked on a voluntary basis for 12 years before becoming executive
            director
            in 2000. Under her leadership, Coptic Orphans has established a grassroots network of over 750 volunteer child
            advocates
            in Egypt and mobilized thousands of donors and supporters worldwide.
            She has overseen the organization’s expansion into development programs in literacy, girls’ empowerment,
            microfinance
            for widowed mothers, and peace-building initiatives to strengthen Egyptian communities for sustainable impact. For
            its
            role in connecting Copts abroad to communities in Egypt, Coptic Orphans has been singled out as a unique model for
            diaspora-led development.
            Today, in addition to its headquarters in the United States, Ms. Riad has transformed Coptic Orphans into a global
            charity with offices in Egypt, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom; that has reached over 75,000 vulnerable
            children in Egypt.
            Under Ms. Riad’s leadership, Coptic Orphans has received numerous awards and was named a semi-finalist in the
            Washington
            Post Excellence in Nonprofit Management Award. In addition, Ms. Riad is a recipient of the United Nations
            Association of
            the National Capital Area’s Community Human Rights Award; and the Women’s Forum Excellence in Leadership Award.
            Ms. Riad holds a Master of Arts in Public Administration from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, as well as a Bachelor
            of
            Science in Electrical Engineering. Prior to establishing Coptic Orphans, Ms. Riad worked throughout the Middle East
            as
            an engineer with the United States Foreign Service.</p>

<p class="rp">Rania Petro has developed a tight emotional bond with Coptic Orphans since she moved to the United States
    in 2009 when
    she got involved as a volunteer in various capacities. Before moving to the United States, she worked for
    multinational
    advertising and branding agencies in Egypt such as Memac Ogilvy & Mather and Superbrands. She also applied her
    advertising and communication expertise in the field of development, especially in offering capacity-building

    Communication and specialized in Integrated Marketing Communication. She holds a couple of diplomas in Marketing

                judges.
                
                Joshua developed a love for non-profit work while leading the immigration department of the Philadelphia Christian Legal
